---

### Week 3: thinkube-control Goes Public
**Status**: 🔒 PRIVATE → 🌍 PUBLIC (First Public Repo)
**Public Exposure**: Small (1 repo, limited visibility)
**Risk Level**: ⬜️⬜️ MEDIUM

#### Objectives
- Audit thinkube-control (copyright, security)
- Transfer from `cmxela` to `thinkube` organization
- Make repository public
- Update all references

#### Why Third?
- Smaller codebase = easier to audit
- Test case for public release process
- Required before installer (installer references this)
- Limited impact if issues arise

#### Deliverables
- [ ] All thinkube-control files audited
- [ ] Repository in `thinkube` organization
- [ ] Repository is PUBLIC: `https://github.com/thinkube/thinkube-control`
- [ ] Local references updated

#### Public Visibility
🟢 **LOW**: Repo is public but not advertised
- Search engines may index
- GitHub users can discover
- No install instructions yet = limited adoption
- Installer still private

#### Dependencies
- Week 2 complete (learned audit process)
- thinkube-control exists and works

**See**: [PUBLIC_RELEASE_PREPARATION.md](PUBLIC_RELEASE_PREPARATION.md#week-3-thinkube-control-repository-migration)

---

### Week 4: Main Repository Goes Public
**Status**: 🔒 PRIVATE → 🌍 PUBLIC
**Public Exposure**: Medium (2 repos, still not advertised)
**Risk Level**: ⬜️⬜️ MEDIUM

#### Objectives
- Final security review
- Configure GitHub (issues, discussions, templates)
- Set up branch protection
- Add basic GitHub Actions
- Make main repository public

#### Why Fourth?
- Week 2 prep work is complete
- thinkube-control already public (dependency met)
- Can test public workflow with smaller repo first
- Still no installer = no easy way to install = limited adoption

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Final review complete
- [ ] GitHub features configured
- [ ] Repository is PUBLIC: `https://github.com/thinkube/thinkube`
- [ ] No critical issues reported

#### Public Visibility
🟡 **MEDIUM**: Repos are public but still not easy to install
- More discoverable on GitHub
- Code is visible and readable
- Contributors can fork
- BUT: No installer = high barrier to entry
- Protects us from premature adoption

#### Dependencies
- Week 2 audit complete

## Dependencies Graph

```
Week 1 (code-server)
   ↓
Week 2 (Main Repo Audit) ← Uses code-server from Week 1
   ↓
Week 3 (thinkube-control) ← Applies Week 2 process
   ↓
Week 4 (Main Repo Public) ← Requires Week 3 success
   ↓
Week 5 (Installer Launch) ← Requires EVERYTHING
   ↓
Week 6 (Documentation)
```

**Critical Path**: Every week depends on previous weeks
**No Shortcuts**: Can't skip steps without risk

---

## Communication Plan

### Internal (Pre-Launch)
- Daily progress updates
- Blockers identified immediately
- Security findings communicated privately

### External (Post-Launch)
- GitHub Discussions for community
- Issues for bugs and features
- Social media for announcements
- Blog for deep dives

---

## Rollback Plans

### If Week 3 Goes Wrong (thinkube-control)
🔄 **Action**: Make repository private again
✅ **Impact**: LOW - small repo, limited exposure
✅ **Recovery**: Fix issues, re-audit, try again

### If Week 4 Goes Wrong (Main Repo)
🔄 **Action**: Make repository private again
⚠️ **Impact**: MEDIUM - more visible, some users may have cloned
⚠️ **Recovery**: Fix issues, communicate, relaunch

### If Week 5 Goes Wrong (Installer)
🔄 **Action**: Don't announce, fix installer first
🔴 **Impact**: HIGH if already announced
✅ **Prevention**: DON'T ANNOUNCE until installer tested thoroughly

---

## Phase 5 Transition

After Phase 4.5 completes:
- ✅ Have working development environment (code-server)
- ✅ Repositories are public and clean
- ✅ Community can contribute
- ✅ Easy installation for users

**Phase 5 Can Now**:
- Use code-server to develop templates
- Accept community contributions
- Test templates with real users
- Build on solid public foundation

---

## Conclusion

Phase 4.5 transforms Thinkube in two major ways:
